# FitBit-Analysis
Fitbit Consumer Behavior Analysis Project

As part of my data analytics experience, I conducted an extensive analysis of Fitbit consumer data to uncover trends and provide actionable insights. The project involved:

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing daily activity, sleep, heart rate, and weight data to identify patterns in consumer behavior.
Segmentation and Trend Analysis: Segmenting users based on activity and sleep patterns, and identifying key behavior trends that impact user health and wellness.
Creating Visualizations: Developing dashboards and visualizations in Tableau and Python to present findings effectively.
Strategic Recommendations: Offering data-driven marketing strategies to optimize product offerings and enhance customer engagement.
